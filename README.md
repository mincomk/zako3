## What is Zako?
**Zako** is basically a combination of Discord music bot and TTS bot. It serves various audio tracks to Discord voice channels.

## Motivation
There are a lot of people refusing to reveal one's voice(i.e. no-mic users) in Discord culture. They usually turns their microphone off and only listen, and saying through chat. However, majority of people cannot always see chat channel if they are doing something else. Therefore, developers have made some bots that read chat channels with TTS technology. Although they are very well-made and good, I've found some problems and better approaches in those bots.
### The Problems
- **Blocking** They don't read a message until they complete reading current message.
- **Lack of Customizability** They let users to use only handful of TTS voices. Users cannot customize their voice.
