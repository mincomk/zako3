## What is Zako?
**Zako** is basically a combination of Discord music bot and TTS bot. It serves various audio tracks to Discord voice channels.

## Motivation
There are a lot of people refusing to reveal one's voice(i.e. no-mic users) in Discord culture. They usually turns their microphone off and only listen, and saying through chat. However, majority of people cannot always see chat channel if they are doing something else. Therefore, developers have made some bots that read chat channels with TTS technology. Although they are very well-made and good, I've found some problems and better approaches in those bots.
### The Problems
- **Blocking** They don't read a message until they complete reading current message.
- **Lack of Customizability** They let users to use only handful of TTS voices. Users cannot customize their voice.

## Contributors
Contributors listed in the main `README.md` are the ones who influenced signifiacnt things to the growth of Zako3.
The project is mainly developed by Minco alone nowadays. Thus, not only big code change but also just having interest in Zako provides strong motivation to Minco, which ultimately leads to active development.
Also, it is intentional that this section is not automated. I want to show that I care every single contributors by manually updating the list every time it changes.
- MincoMK (Discord: `@minco_rl`) - Zako
- Kanowara Sinoka (Discord: `@u_sinokadev`) - Devised a lot of features. The one made Zako3 exist.
