Of course. Based on your request for an elegant, modular, and testable architecture, I suggest a structure inspired by Clean Architecture principles. This separates concerns into distinct layers, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and reason about.

Here is a proposed directory structure that aligns with your vision:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── user.rs             # Defines the core User entity, value objects, and domain events.
│   ├── settings.rs         # Defines the Settings entity.
│   └── ...                 # Other domain models.
│
├── repository/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── user_repository.rs  # `pub trait UserRepository` - The abstraction for user data access.
│   ├── settings_repository.rs # `pub trait SettingsRepository`
│   └── token_repository.rs # `pub trait TokenRepository`
│
├── service/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── user_service.rs     # Business logic for user operations, depends on repository traits.
│   ├── auth_service.rs     # Logic for authentication, can depend on multiple repositories.
│   └── ...                 # Other shared business logic services.
│
├── usecase/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── create_user.rs      # A single, specific use case for creating a user.
│   ├── get_user_by_id.rs   # A specific use case for retrieving a user.
│   ├── login.rs            # The login use case.
│   └── ...                 # Each file corresponds to a single application-specific task.
│
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── postgres/
│   │   ├── user_repository.rs # `impl repository::user::UserRepository for ...`
│   │   └── ...
│   └── redis/
│       ├── token_repository.rs # `impl repository::token::TokenRepository for ...`
│       └── ...
│
├── http/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── router.rs           # Defines the HTTP routes and maps them to handlers.
│   ├── user_handler.rs     # Handles HTTP requests for users, calling the relevant use cases.
│   ├── auth_handler.rs     # Handles auth-related requests.
│   └── middleware/
│       └── auth.rs         # Authentication middleware.
│
└── lib.rs                  # Crate root: dependency injection, configuration, and wiring layers together.
```

### How this maps to your request:

1.  **`repository/`**: This is your "repository abstracting actual IO". It contains the `trait` definitions that the application's business logic will depend on, without knowing about the database specifics.

2.  **`service/`**: This is your "something abstracting common use of them". These services can contain business logic that is shared across multiple use cases. For example, a `UserService` might orchestrate calls to `UserRepository` and other repositories to perform complex operations that are needed by more than one endpoint.

3.  **`usecase/`**: This is your "something abstracting actual usecase". Each file in this directory would ideally represent a single, atomic action your application can perform (e.g., `CreateUser`, `UpdateSettings`). These use cases are called directly by the HTTP handlers and depend on the abstractions provided by the `service` and `repository` layers. This makes them highly focused and easy to test.

4.  **`http/`**: This is your "HTTP endpoint" layer. Its sole responsibility is to handle HTTP requests and responses. It parses incoming requests, calls the appropriate `usecase`, and formats the result back to the client. It contains no business logic.

### Benefits of this approach:

*   **Testability**: You can test your `usecase` and `service` logic by providing mock implementations of the `repository` traits, completely independent of the database or web framework.
*   **Modularity**: Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility. You can change the database (`infrastructure`) or the web framework (`http`) with minimal impact on your core business logic (`domain`, `service`, `usecase`).
*   **Clarity**: The dependency rule is simple: outer layers depend on inner layers. `http` depends on `usecase`, `usecase` depends on `service` and `repository`, and `infrastructure` implements `repository`. The `domain` is at the core and depends on nothing.

This structure provides a solid foundation for a robust and scalable application.
