# Zako3 Project Management Plan
This plan takes the most abstract bird's eye view of Zako[^1]. This document does not help understanding any technical thing, but unifies any people interested in Zako into a single goal.

## The Vision
The vision is a long-term goal of Zako. It is a North Star that unites contributors.
- Break down voice communication barriers between users.
- Make voice conversation always full of entertainments.

## Technical Goals
We also define technical goals that maintains stable project growth.
- **No Zako4**. Never expect fresh run of a next generation project, and do your best designing Zako3.
- **Be scalable**. Again, no Zako4. So the primary design goal of Zako3 is to be scalable. Developers should be able to easily add any kind of feature to Zako3.
- **Perfectionist? No**. Ironic, but it should be. Always seek "As long as it works." approach in top-down manner. Moreover, leave a space to be perfect. Although we should not be a perfectionist, we should retain an abstract plan to be perfect.

## The Milestones
Zako3 project is being actively developed. We define large milestones that make a significant event on the lifecycle of Zako3.
- **Plan**
    - Developers have an abstract plan of technical things in Zako3.
    - Developers are familiar to the development stack.
- **Systematize**
    - The project has all sub-projects prepared.
    - At least one implementation in each logical module exists.
    - Contributors can easily add a feature without implementing boilerplate or designing module architecture.
- **Deploy**
    - The project has all features implemented.
    - Users can use Zako3 normally.
    - Zako3 is being managed in production-grade manner.
> [!NOTE]
> Zako3 has finished **Plan** milestone. We are working for **Systematize**.

[^1]: We say it not as Zako3 but as Zako, as it is an entire plan of Zako.
